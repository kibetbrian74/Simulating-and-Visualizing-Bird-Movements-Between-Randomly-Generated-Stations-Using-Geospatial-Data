# Simulating-and-Visualizing-Bird-Movements-Between-Randomly-Generated-Stations-Using-Geospatial-Data
The code simulates the movement of birds between various stations, generating data points for each visit, including the station visited, exact (slightly perturbed) coordinates, and a timestamp. This data is stored in a GeoDataFrame that can be used for spatial analysis and visualization.
